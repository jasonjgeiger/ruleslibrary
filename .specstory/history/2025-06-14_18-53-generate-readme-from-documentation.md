I've updated the README to make it clear that these rules are specifically for development within the Cursor IDE. The main changes include:

1. Updated the title and description to specify Cursor IDE
2. Clarified that chat interaction rules are for Cursor's AI assistant
3. Added a "Cursor-Specific Guidelines" section
4. Updated the analytics section to specify Cursor rules
5. Modified the contributing section to reference Cursor specifically
6. Updated file descriptions to clarify their Cursor-specific nature

The README now better reflects that this is a collection of rules and guidelines specifically designed for development within the Cursor IDE environment. Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify or modify?
