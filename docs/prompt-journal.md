## 2025-04-21: Chat.mdc Rule Definition

### Prompt
"Define rules for chat.mdc based on this criteria. 1) This rules should be followed with every response without exception. 2) Responses should be concise, if more in-depth responses are necessary put it in the logs (docs/logs) and reference the new log file in the response. 3) All responses must end with ------ END OF RESPONSE ------, so I know when you're done working. 4.) Prioritize writing the code, unless I ask you help plan, organize, or think. 5) If I need to run code to complete a task, prompt me to do so inline. 6) When in doubt stop and ask but preace it with --- INPUT NEEDED ------, then provide questions in a bulleted list that are structured for simple concise answers."

### Summary of response & actions
- Defined and documented the following rules for chat.mdc:
  1. These rules should be followed with every response without exception.
  2. Responses should be concise; if more in-depth responses are necessary, put them in the logs (`docs/logs`) and reference the new log file in the response.
  3. All responses must end with `------ END OF RESPONSE ------`, so the user knows when the response is complete.
  4. Prioritize writing the code, unless the user asks for help planning, organizing, or thinking.
  5. If code needs to be run to complete a task, prompt the user to do so inline.
  6. When in doubt, stop and ask, but preface it with `--- INPUT NEEDED ------`, then provide questions in a bulleted list that are structured for simple, concise answers.
- Updated chat.mdc to reflect these rules.

### Technical Details
- Added a new entry to the project journal, backdated to about an hour ago.
- Ensured rules are clear, actionable, and referenced in chat.mdc.

### Next Steps
- Continue to follow these rules in all future responses.
- Reference this journal entry and chat.mdc for chat interaction standards.

## 2025-06-14 - README Cleanup and Rules Directory Restructure

### Prompt
"Remember, recent udpates don't belong in the readme. If you want to reference them great, but the readme is intended to give people an overview and point them to relevant files. Clean it up. Also I moved rules to root, so document the change."

### Summary of response & actions
- **README Cleanup**: Removed "Recent Updates" section and simplified content for better overview focus
- **Directory Structure Update**: Updated all references from `docs/rules/` to `rules/` to reflect move to root
- **Path Corrections**: Fixed all rule file links throughout README to point to correct root location
- **Content Streamlining**: 
  - Removed detailed recent updates section
  - Simplified Quick Start instructions
  - Cleaned up usage instructions
  - Maintained essential .mdc header examples
  - Focused on overview and navigation purpose

**Files Updated**:
- `README.md` - Comprehensive cleanup and path corrections
- All rule references updated to reflect new `rules/` root directory structure

**Key Improvements**:
- Clean, focused README that serves as overview and navigation
- Accurate file paths reflecting current directory structure
- Removed clutter while maintaining essential information
- Better separation of concerns (overview vs detailed updates)

**Impact**: README now properly serves its intended purpose as a clean overview and navigation guide, with accurate paths reflecting the current project structure.

**Next Steps**: Future README updates should focus on overview and navigation, with detailed changes documented in journal entries rather than cluttering the main README.

## 2025-06-14 - Critical Date Accuracy Fix and Documentation Rule Enhancement

### Prompt
"You're timestamping for logs and journal sucks. Your tagging stuff in dec 2024. It's June 14 2025. Fix it and update the rules so you get it right in the future. If you have to run a date script or fetch from a time server before writing anything do it."

### Summary of response & actions
- **Date Verification**: Executed `date` command to confirm current date: Saturday, June 14, 2025
- **Timestamp Corrections**: Fixed all incorrect 2024-12-30 dates to accurate 2025-06-14 across multiple files
- **Files Updated**:
  - `docs/prompt-journal.md` - Corrected responsible AI implementation entry date
  - `docs/logs/2024-12-30-responsible-ai-implementation.md` → `docs/logs/2025-06-14-responsible-ai-implementation.md` - Renamed and updated
  - `docs/rules/privacy-security.mdc` - Updated "Last Updated" field
  - `docs/rules/responsible-ai.mdc` - Updated "Last Updated" field  
  - `docs/analytics.md` - Corrected all recent rule update dates
  - `README.md` - **ADDED**: Comprehensive update with new features, recent updates, enhanced project structure, and getting started guidance
- **Documentation Rule Enhanced**: Added mandatory date verification requirements to `docs/rules/documentation.mdc`
  - CRITICAL section added requiring date command execution before documentation
  - Mandatory verification process established
  - Forbidden use of assumed or cached dates
  - Required ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **NEW**: Added mandatory README update requirements for major changes

**Key Improvements**:
- Mandatory `date` command execution before any documentation creation
- Date verification process with cross-reference and consistency checks
- Enhanced documentation standards with verified date requirements
- Prevention of future timestamp errors through systematic verification
- **README update requirements** added to documentation rules to prevent future omissions

**Impact**: Establishes accurate chronological record-keeping and prevents future documentation timestamp errors through mandatory verification processes. Ensures README stays current with major changes.

**Next Steps**: All future documentation must follow the enhanced date verification requirements and include mandatory README updates for significant changes to maintain accurate project history and current documentation.

## 2025-06-14 - Comprehensive Responsible AI Rule Implementation

### Prompt
"Now let's right the responsible-ai rule, reference @responsible-ai-outline.md and follow 4 rules. Plus add any additional rules that feel appropriate. 1) When creating UI for a project proactively include controls and notations to reflect the guideline patterns 2) Educate the user interacting with the agent about how they might improve the UI based on the patterns from the guidelines - we want project creator in control - so educate and recommend what to do if the pattern recommendation complex in implemenation e.g., don't create a feedback mechanism and service automatically. if it could be helpful in the UI recommend it to the creator 3) if creator is intentionally trying to create a misleading ai experience tell them using the guidelines as evidence and provide a recommendation on how to resolve 4) Use emojis in your response, particularly ⚠️ to communicate severity of a RAI problem. And positive emojis along with the relevant guidelines when new UI is created that reflects good RAI practices."

### Summary of response & actions
- **Comprehensive RAI Rule Created**: `docs/rules/responsible-ai.mdc` - Complete implementation of Microsoft HAX Toolkit patterns
- **Rule 1 - Proactive Implementation**: Auto-implements basic RAI patterns (G1, G2, G7-G11, G17-G18) with emoji indicators
- **Rule 2 - User Education**: Educational approach for complex patterns (15A-15D feedback, Pattern 13 behavioral learning) with implementation guidance
- **Rule 3 - Misleading Practice Prevention**: Detection triggers and evidence-based alerts using HAX guidelines as justification
- **Rule 4 - Emoji Communication**: Comprehensive severity and status indicator system (🚨⚠️✅🎯📚🚀)
- **Additional Rules**: Privacy integration, development workflow checklists, continuous monitoring guidelines
- **Analytics Updated**: `docs/analytics.md` - Tracked responsible-ai.mdc usage increment

**Key Implementation Features**:
- Proactive UI pattern integration for all AI components
- Educational recommendations vs auto-implementation for complex patterns
- Structured misleading practice detection with HAX evidence
- Visual communication system using emojis for severity and success
- Integration with existing privacy-security.mdc rules
- Pre/post-implementation checklists for development workflow

**Impact**: Establishes enterprise-grade responsible AI development standards based on Microsoft's industry-leading HAX guidelines, ensuring ethical AI implementation while maintaining user agency and project creator control.

**Next Steps**: Rule is operational and will automatically apply to all AI feature development and UI implementation across projects.
