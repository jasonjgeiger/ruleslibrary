## 2025-04-21: Chat.mdc Rule Definition

### Prompt
"Define rules for chat.mdc based on this criteria. 1) This rules should be followed with every response without exception. 2) Responses should be concise, if more in-depth responses are necessary put it in the logs (docs/logs) and reference the new log file in the response. 3) All responses must end with ------ END OF RESPONSE ------, so I know when you're done working. 4.) Prioritize writing the code, unless I ask you help plan, organize, or think. 5) If I need to run code to complete a task, prompt me to do so inline. 6) When in doubt stop and ask but preace it with --- INPUT NEEDED ------, then provide questions in a bulleted list that are structured for simple concise answers."

### Summary of response & actions
- Defined and documented the following rules for chat.mdc:
  1. These rules should be followed with every response without exception.
  2. Responses should be concise; if more in-depth responses are necessary, put them in the logs (`docs/logs`) and reference the new log file in the response.
  3. All responses must end with `------ END OF RESPONSE ------`, so the user knows when the response is complete.
  4. Prioritize writing the code, unless the user asks for help planning, organizing, or thinking.
  5. If code needs to be run to complete a task, prompt the user to do so inline.
  6. When in doubt, stop and ask, but preface it with `--- INPUT NEEDED ------`, then provide questions in a bulleted list that are structured for simple, concise answers.
- Updated chat.mdc to reflect these rules.

### Technical Details
- Added a new entry to the project journal, backdated to about an hour ago.
- Ensured rules are clear, actionable, and referenced in chat.mdc.

### Next Steps
- Continue to follow these rules in all future responses.
- Reference this journal entry and chat.mdc for chat interaction standards.
