# Rules Library for Cursor IDE

A comprehensive library of development rules and documentation guidelines for projects using the Cursor IDE, featuring enterprise-grade privacy, security, and responsible AI implementation standards.

## Quick Start

1. Review the [Documentation Guidelines](docs/rules/documentation.mdc) for how to document and journal your work with **mandatory date verification**.
2. Familiarize yourself with all [Project Rules](#rules-overview) before contributing code.
3. Check the [Project Journal](docs/prompt-journal.md) for recent milestones and context.
4. Use the [Chat Interaction Rules](docs/rules/chat.mdc) when working with Cursor AI.
5. Follow the [Git Rules](docs/rules/git.mdc) for version control, commit, and branching best practices.
6. **NEW**: Implement [Privacy & Security Rules](docs/rules/privacy-security.mdc) for secure development practices.
7. **NEW**: Apply [Responsible AI Rules](docs/rules/responsible-ai.mdc) based on Microsoft HAX Guidelines for ethical AI development.

## Recent Updates (2025-06-14)

- âœ… **Critical Date Accuracy Fix**: Implemented mandatory date verification for all documentation
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy & Security Rules**: Comprehensive security guidelines with auto-attachment for all relevant file types
- ðŸ¤– **Responsible AI Rules**: Complete Microsoft HAX Toolkit implementation with 18 guidelines and pattern catalog
- ðŸ“‹ **Enhanced Documentation**: Mandatory date verification process to prevent timestamp errors
- ðŸŽ¯ **Auto-Attachment**: Smart file type targeting for automatic rule application

## Usage

To integrate this rules library into your own Cursor project:

1. **Copy the Rules and Documentation**
   - Copy the rules you want from `docs/rules/` directory and paste them into your project's `.cursor/rules/`.
   - Optionally, copy `docs/prompt-journal.md` and `docs/logs/` if you want to maintain journaling and logs.

2. **Update References**
   - Adjust any project-specific references in the rules files (e.g., file paths, team conventions).
   - Update the `README.md` in your project to reference the rules and documentation as needed.

3. **Adopt the Workflow**
   - Follow the documentation, journaling, and version control practices described in the rules.
   - Use the Chat Interaction Rules when working with Cursor AI.
   - Implement privacy and security practices from the comprehensive security rules.
   - Apply responsible AI guidelines for any AI-enabled features.
   - Track rule usage with the analytics system if desired.

4. **Customize as Needed**
   - Modify or extend the rules to fit your team's workflow or technology stack.
   - Add new `.mdc` files for additional frameworks or processes.

5. **Best Practices**
   - **CRITICAL**: Always verify current date before creating documentation entries
   - Keep your rules and documentation up to date as your project evolves.
   - Encourage all contributors to review and follow the rules.
   - Regularly review the journal and logs for project history and technical decisions.
   - Implement security and responsible AI practices from day one.
